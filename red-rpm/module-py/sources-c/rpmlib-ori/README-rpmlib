Note:

    Most glue routines from libRPM to Python are static and thus not visible from the outside.
    In order not to reinvent the wheel, I had to duplicate many of the LibRPM glue functions.

    Files (*.c || *.h) present in the directory are UNMODIFIED from git source code.
    Nevertheless as DNF only use a limited subset of LibRPM Pythin API not everyfile was
    duplicated, 

    Would RpmLIB maintainers turn RpmLib Python glue methods from 'static' to 'public' that this 
    code duplication would become useless.
